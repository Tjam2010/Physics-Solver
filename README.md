# Physics-Solver

The project was created as a means of hastening the completion of physics homework.

To run, open the jar and follow the steps. 
You are provided, initially, options for what kind of physics problem is being solved.
Once you select one, continue to the next section where you choose which variable to evaluate.
Finally input the known factors (Likely input 0 if unknown, but use your best judgement)
Calculate to get the result!

Enjoy!
